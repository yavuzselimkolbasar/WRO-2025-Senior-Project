# ============================================
#       AI-POWERED LEGO ROBOT FOR WRO 2025      
# ============================================

This project is a camera-based autonomous robot built for WRO 2025. It is powered by a Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB) and LEGO motors via the Build HAT. The robot uses OpenCV for real-time line following and object detection, and it incorporates a TCS230/TCS3200 color sensor for additional decision-making.

**Key Features:**
- **Camera-based Line Following:** Uses OpenCV to detect and follow lines.
- **Object Detection with AI:** Implements lightweight AI models for obstacle avoidance.
- **Color Sensor Input:** Employs a TCS230/TCS3200 sensor for color-based decisions.
- **LEGO Motor Control:** Operated via the Raspberry Pi Build HAT.
- **Uninterrupted Operation:** Can be powered with a Geekworm X1200 UPS for backup power.

This robot is designed for real-time AI processing, providing a fast and adaptive performance compared to traditional pre-programmed robots.
